Edge cases
	- n = 0, n = -1, n = 1, n = 2^31, n = -2^31
	- List is empty, or contains 1 element
	- Even/odd cases
	- Empty/single vertex in graph
	- Multigraph (loops/multiple edges)
	- Empty line in input

WA
	- Try small cases
	- Create a test case generator
	- Can floating point numbers be avoided using large integers?

TLE
	- Randomized algorithms
	- Precompute answers
	- Compute all queries at the same time
	- Bitsets

Seaching
	- Can your search be how many elements > n?
	- Rephrase search as yes/no rather than specific element
	- Test objective function with linear search first

DP
	- Swap answer and parameter
	- Drop a paramter and recover it from others
	- Bottom up might be easier
	- State contains intervals rather than current element

Math
	- Look for a pattern
	- Consider the cycles of the permutation
	- Sieve
	- If you're looking for expectations, consider solving the problem for probabilities first
	- Assume you're player 1 in 

Graphs
	- Can the problem be modeled as a graph
	- Does the graph have any neat properties
	- Strongly connected components
	- Cycles
	- Bipartite Matching
	- Cut vertex/bridge
	- Degrees of vertices
	- Eulerian path/circuit
	- Toposort
	- Max flow

Trees
	- Least common ancestor
	- Euler tour
	- Tree center
	- DFS traversal
		- entry/exit times
	- Tree is a line graph
	- Consier subtrees

Strings
	- Hashing
	- Work with S+S
