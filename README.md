# personal-library

Some library of snippets/algorithms implemented in C++.
I mainly use these for competitive programming.

Code may be crappy.
Code may also be untested.
Feel free to roast me.

- This library is intented to be used as snippets, rather than for importing.
 - pls dont judge the weird menial stuff i include here

- Add headers that contain the following:
  - Name of the algo/DS/technique
  - Short description
  - Notes
  - Problem for verification
  - Reference/s

- If an algorithm is named after its inventor, include what it solves in its title
  - e.g. Shortest Paths - Dijkstra's

## TODO:
- math/number theoretic stuff
  - matrices (inverse, etc)
- data structures
  - fenwick
  - other flavors of segtrees
- strings
  - a nicer hash function
  - suffix array
- searching
  - binary/ternary search over a continuous range
- graphs
  - flows
- geometry
- more ideas for the idea bank
- actually do some testing
